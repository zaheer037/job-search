"""Guards for /scrape's result-provenance recording.

The scraper is a markdown spec (the spec IS the implementation), so these
tests pin the invariants that would break silently: seen_jobs.json entries
record whether they came from a portal CLI or the WebSearch fallback
(`source`), and the Step 5 summary names the portals that ran on the
fallback. Together these keep a ghost-job report diagnosable days after
the run's scrollback is gone (#331): a stale-index entry, a live-CLI
entry, and a job with no entry at all each point at a different mechanism.
