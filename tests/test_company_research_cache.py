"""Guards for the company-research cache spec.

/apply Step 3's reviewer agent and /interview Step 2 each independently execute
the Company Research Checklist (04-job-evaluation.md) for the same company when
both commands run against the same application - confirmed by reading both
files, not assumed. The cache lets either consumer reuse a recent result
instead of repeating the search/fetch work. These are markdown specs (the spec
IS the implementation), so these tests pin the invariants that would break
silently: that the cache is actually read before researching, and - the part
most likely to be dropped in a future edit, since it is easy to add the read
half and forget the write half - that fresh research gets written back for
the next consumer to find.
