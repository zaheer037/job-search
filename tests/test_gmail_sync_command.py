"""Guards for /gmail-sync's Gmail query semantics.

The command's stated intent is "skip sent/drafts - status signals come
from what employers send you". `in:inbox` does not mean that: it matches
only messages currently IN the inbox, so it also excludes every archived
message - and, self-defeatingly, the mail matched by the very
job-search label Step 3.1 hunts for, because the standard filter that
applies such a label also archives ("skip the inbox"). The correct
operators for the stated intent are `-in:sent -in:drafts` (review
finding F18, 2026-08-19). The failure mode is silent under-detection: a
missed rejection or interview invite just looks like "no updates".
