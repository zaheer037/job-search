"""Guards for the rule that keeps free-form `notes` from breaking a tracker row.

No writer in this framework emits a quoted tracker field, so a comma inside
`notes` splits the row - for the `csv.DictReader` in `tools/rank_state.py` as
much as for a naive split - and shifts `cv_file`, `cover_letter_file` and
`source` a column left. A line break is worse: it ends the row. Two writers put
free-form text into `notes`: `/gmail-sync` Step 7a copies an email subject, and
`/outcome` Step 4 writes a short note of its own. The fixed-format writers
(`followed up YYYY-MM-DD`, `stale resolved no_response (YYYY-MM-DD)`,
`redrafted`) cannot contain the characters and are not listed.

The spec IS the implementation, so the guard is `CASES`: each rule must sit on
the line that instructs the append, not merely somewhere in the section. The
shape tests below it parse with `csv.DictReader` and document why the rule
exists; they pass on master too.
