"""Guards for /outcome's follow-up branch (Step 2b).

The branch is part of the /outcome markdown spec (the spec IS the
implementation), so these tests pin the invariants that would break
silently: the draft-only rule (the branch must never send anything on the
user's behalf), the no-new-claims rule that keeps follow-ups inside the
framework's never-fabricate boundary, the two-follow-up cap that terminates
into /outcome's own no_response flow, and the deliberate contrast with
/gmail-sync's 30-day staleness flag.
