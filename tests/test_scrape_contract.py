"""Tests for the /scrape Step 2 search-output contract across portal CLIs.

Mirrors the pattern of test_html_report_command.py: derive the contract from
the spec itself and compare it against the real portal CLIs, so a drift on
either side fails with a clean diff.

Why this test exists: .agents/skills/scrape/SKILL.md Step 2 promises
"Search output already includes title, company, location, date, and URL" for
every portal CLI, and Step 4.75's degraded scan flags "company null or empty
on every result" as a half-working parser. A CLI that quietly stops emitting
those fields flags the portal as degraded on every /scrape run while CI stays
green, breaks the seen_jobs.json dedupe (url_or_company_title_key), and leaves
/rank without a posting URL. That failure class landed for real: jobnet-search
emitted only the raw API schema and jobdanmark-search emitted companyName with
no company/location/date keys until both were normalized.

{helpers.ts, commands/search.ts} are the two files where every registered
CLI's search output currently lives (HTML-parsing portals normalize in
helpers.ts, API portals in commands/search.ts). detail.ts is deliberately
excluded: the contract is about the search output /scrape consumes.
