"""Guards for the onboarding privacy warnings (issue #345).

The README's quick start walks a new user into creating a public fork
(forks of public repos cannot be private) and then has /setup write
personal data into tracked files, with the only complete warning sitting
in SETUP.md section 8 - a section about pulling updates, downstream of
the decision it should inform. A real user hit exactly this. These tests
pin that the warning lives at the point of decision (adjacent to both
fork commands) and that /setup checks the origin's visibility BEFORE
writing anything, not in its closing notes.
