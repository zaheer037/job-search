"""Guards for the tracker status vocabulary (issue #298).

The tracker CSV `status` column has a single authoritative definition in
/outcome's "Tracker status vocabulary" block. Every reader that mentions
final or open statuses must defer to that block or explicitly accept both
the canonical underscore spellings and the legacy space spellings on read.

These tests pin the two concrete bugs that opened #298:

1. `offer declined` (space form, written by the old /outcome Step 4) landed
   in no /html-report bucket, silently shrinking the rejection-rate denominator.
2. `interview_only` was listed as a tracker bucket value in /html-report, but
   it belongs to the archive outcome.md Status: enum, never the CSV column.

They also pin the review findings on the fix itself:

3. The space spellings are the same statuses as the underscore forms (equally
   Final), so a reader applying the lists literally cannot land on "not Final,
   not Open, undefined" - which would otherwise misroute a closed application
   in /apply's append-vs-update decision.
4. The vocabulary block must not split Step 1's numbered list: section-scoped
   reads of Step 1 must still see items 2-4.
5. /html-report's bucket map needs a catch-all so no tracker value drops out of
   the stats silently, and /notion-sync must normalise space forms before
   writing Status (Notion auto-creates a select option per unique string).
6. /apply and /interview make status decisions and must anchor them to the
   block, not restate an ad-hoc set.

They follow the CASES-table pattern from test_apply_records_application.py so
that adding a new reader is a one-line addition to READER_CASES.
