"""Guards for /apply's tracker recording step (Step 6b).

The step is part of the /apply markdown spec (the spec IS the
implementation), so these tests pin the invariants that would break
silently. Assertions are scoped to the section they belong to, following
the pattern in test_upskill_skill.py: a whole-file `assertIn` for a word
as common as `drafted` passes on any unrelated mention and guards nothing.

The CSV header is the one rule most easily lost: it must stay
byte-identical to /outcome's, which is the entire reason for reusing it.
How each reader treats `drafted` is pinned per reader below, because the
right answer differs between them.
