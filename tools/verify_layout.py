"""Measure a compiled CV or cover letter's page layout, instead of eyeballing it.

The compile-and-inspect loop in `05-cv-templates.md` and the verification checklist in
AGENTS.md already require the layout properties below. Nothing executes them: they are
checked by looking at the rendered page, which is exactly how they get missed. Each
failure below produces a clean compile, a correct page count, and a PDF that passes
`tools/verify_pdf.py`:

  orphaned entry      A moderncv \\cventry renders as a tabular, so a job entry is one
                      unbreakable block. When it does not fit, the whole entry moves to
                      the next page - or its header lands at the bottom of one page with
                      the bullets resuming on the next. AGENTS.md calls this "the most
                      common failure".
  internal hole       The space an ejected entry leaves behind. Observed in the wild at
                      273pt, roughly 19 blank lines, mid-page, on a document whose page
                      count was correct and whose visual read looked fine.
  page ends early     A non-final page that stops well short of the bottom.
  final page thin     A last page mostly empty, which reads as an unfinished document.
  footer collision    Body text pushed into the page-number band, the usual result of
                      rescuing a page with \\enlargethispage or a negative \\vspace.

Page count is deliberately NOT checked here: `tools/verify_pdf.py --pages` already does
that, and CI runs it. Two implementations of one rule drift.

Geometry comes from Poppler word bounding boxes (`pdftotext -bbox`). Poppler is optional
repo-wide - since #369 `verify_pdf.py` prefers pypdf and falls back to Poppler - but word
bounding boxes have no pypdf equivalent, so this is the one step that still wants it.
Without it, or with a broken extractor, the check reports `skipped:` and exits 2 rather
than inventing a layout failure. A broken extractor has two distinct causes: an xpdf-based
`pdftotext` (Git for Windows ships one ahead of Poppler in PATH) has no `-bbox` flag at
all, and Poppler 26.0x before 26.05 aborts `-bbox`/`-bbox-layout`/`-htmlmeta` on a PDF
whose Info dictionary carries an empty string in any field - which `hyperref` writes for
every field it does not set, so any `lualatex`/`pdflatex` document built with `hyperref`
and no `\hypersetup{pdftitle=...}` triggers a real Poppler crashing on a legal PDF (#451).
Line height serves
as a font-size proxy to spot section headings; left edge (xMin) separates bullet lines
from entry headers.

The thresholds below are calibrated for the stock moderncv (`cv/`) and cover.cls
(`cover_letters/`) geometry. A template registered via `/add-template` may need them
retuned - an article-class page number sitting outside the 90pt footer band, for
instance, is read as body text and turns the space above it into a phantom hole.

Usage:
    python tools/verify_layout.py cv/main_acme_ml_engineer.pdf
    python tools/verify_layout.py cover_letters/cover_acme_ml_engineer.pdf

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 layout problem, 2 bad invocation or no usable extractor.

The shipped `cv/main_example.pdf` exits 1 by design: its placeholder page 2 is mostly
empty, which is the thin-final-page failure the checklist asks you to fix before sending.

Tests live in tests/test_verify_layout.py and run against synthetic pages, so the
suite needs neither Poppler nor a compiled PDF.
